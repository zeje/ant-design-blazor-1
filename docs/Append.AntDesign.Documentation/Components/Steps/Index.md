`Steps` is a navigation bar that guides users through the steps of a task.

## When To Use

When a given task is complicated or has a certain sequence in the series of subtasks, we can decompose it into several steps to make things easier.

## API

```jsx
<Steps>
  <Step title="first step" />
  <Step title="second step" />
  <Step title="third step" />
</Steps>
```
